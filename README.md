# REST API Mini Project

This project is a simple REST API mini project with the following features:

- **Load random cat images**
- **Option to save cat images to favorites section**
- **Render images dynamically**
- **Option to remove cat images from favorites**
- **Option to upload your own cat image**
- **Create thumbnail when image is loaded**


**Note: -IMPORTANT-**

- The **API_KEY** should be handled in the backend. Since this project is only for practicing REST requests without a backend, it is exposed here as an exception.
- If you want to test the code, go to the cat API link, log in, and they will send you your API_KEY to the email. You just have to replace the **API_KEY** in this JS file.
